[00:08.00] (Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
[00:12.20] Trading wept of yesterday
[00:16.20] For what we sing today
[00:19.55] Silent martyrs’ flames
[00:23.00] Burning phonies’ grin
[00:26.20] Sacred breezes, let the bygone return
[00:32.70] All defiers’, slashing disbelief
[00:39.90] Cleave the dark apart
[00:46.20] Through the blood,
[00:49.20] Through the sinners’ smiles
[00:52.10] Cleave, to the hope, to the faith
[00:55.40] To the heart, to the glory of all
[00:59.90] (To the faith, to the heart, from the heart)
[01:01.90] Dawn is breaking in now
[01:10.50] 
[01:22.00] Flame of sun, 
[01:24.40] songs of moon keep on playing
[01:28.30] With roaring tides, rising from our despair(Yeah)
[01:34.20] Take the veils off, show the truth underneath
[01:40.70] Succumb to none
[01:43.80] Shatter the shackles, break them free
[01:48.40] (To the faith, to the heart, from the heart)
[01:51.60] (To the faith, to the heart, from the heart)
[01:52.95] Set them free
[01:55.00] (To the faith, to the heart, from the heart)
[01:58.10] (To the faith, to the heart, from the heart)
[02:00.20] Swallow pieces of sorrow
[02:07.30] Absorb all the pain
[02:13.20] Breathing in, breathing out
[02:16.60] Hold on tight, sliver lining of all
[02:22.00] (Our one last chance)
[02:25.40] Despite blurry clouds
[02:27.80] Blind my eyes, can’t rewrite
[02:31.10] Our triumph’s on my mind
[02:36.20] Victory is shining bright
[02:40.00] Cleave the dark apart (Yeah)
[02:46.40] Through the blood
[02:48.70] Hear the sinners’ cries (Yeah)
[02:53.40] Cleave, to “All will survive,” to leap of faith
[02:56.60] Cleave, to “Don’t look behind,” to dawn’s here to stay (Hey)
[03:01.90] Forever
[03:08.00] (Na-na-na, hey)
[03:10.75] (Ooh, na-na-na-na, na-na-na)
